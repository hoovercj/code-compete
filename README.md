# Code Compete

A platform for code competitions where programmable "players" compete in a variety of online games.

The long-term goal is to have a platform that allows users to submit a "game" written in one of several languages. Users can then submit "players" for that game in the supported language of their choice.

Then users can pit their players against others.

## Try it out

_Prerequisites_: Install the [dotnet core sdk](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hoovercj/code-compete.git
cd code-compete/ConsoleGameHost
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

## Architecture

### Game
A "game" is responsible for telling players to make moves, validating their moves, and ending the game. It does not need to know or care about the type of players it has (computer, console, remote, etc.).

It does this by extending AbstractGame (only .net core is supported at the moment) and by defining the shape of its "state". In the case of Tic Tac Toe, the state is a 2-d string array (3x3).

See [TicTacToe.cs](./TicTacToe/TicTacToeDotNet/TicTacToe.cs)

### Player

A "player" very simple to write. Given a copy of the game state (including all previous moves), it must return the next state of the game. In the case of Tic Tac Toe, a player would receive the current board and all previous boards and would return a new board with their next piece placed.

See [SimpleComputerTicTacToePlayer.cs](TicTacToe/SimpleComputerTicTacToePlayer/SimpleComputerTicTacToePlayer.cs) and [ConsoleTicTacToePlayer.cs](TicTacToe/ConsoleTicTacToePlayer/ConsoleTicTacToePlayer.cs).

### Host

A host is the service that orchestrates a game. An example is [ConsoleGameHost/Program.cs](ConsoleGameHost/Program.cs) which is a .net core console app which starts a Tic Tac Toe game with a computer player and a console player.

A more complicated example is [CliGameService] which executes games and players in separate processes and serializes between them using files.

## Plan

Below is a tentative (and non-exhaustive) list of steps I'll be taking.

### Short-Term

* [X] Write a .net core implementation of a tic-tac-toe game based on the concept of a "game" with "players" outlined above
* [X] Write a console app "host" that that allows playing the above game
* [X] Write wrappers for "players" and "games" so that hosts can communicate with players and/or games in different processes, online, etc.
* [ ] Write a good Tic Tac Toe player in Javascript (node.js) and host to communicate with it in a different process

### Long-Term
* [ ] Push one of the players to an aws lambda function and have the local player face the lambda player
* [ ] Create an asp.net core server to act as a host. It should have a database with a list of (manually entered?) aws lambda functions for games and players and allow users to start existing games against existing players
* [ ] Improve the server to allow new games and players to be added directly from the server
* [ ] Add "users"
* [ ] Make it pretty
